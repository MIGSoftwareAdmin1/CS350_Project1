# CS350_Project1

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    The project was to create a smart thermostat using embedded C programming language and a TI board. It read the room temperature and either sent a signal to run the heat
  or did not, based on the readback from the sensor. An LED was lit if heat was on, giving visual feedback to the user.

What did you do particularly well?
    I did particularly well with understanding the requirements fully and making a best attempt at a minimum viable product on a condensed timeline. I was able to lay most
  of the groundwork for the project in a short span of time with little to no outside guidance. Although in real life, programmers never work in a vacuum, I am proud that
  I was able to accomplish so much of the project solo despite having no experience with embedded C.

Where could you improve?
    I could improve my skill in embedded C more in order to make a more robust program. I was working hard with very basic functionalities, with many failures before
  success. With additional practice, I could become much more efficient in writing programs, and have more time for testing and optimization.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
    I am using the gpio tools .exe in order to setup timers, buttons and other interface tools. While the program only "simulates" the functionality of sending data
  to a server over a WiFi network, all the pieces are there for that also which is quite impressive.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
    Actually, the problem solving portion of this project was the most helpful. I was given a lot of issues to solve in an unfamiliar coding language. It was my
  adaptablility and perserverance that were worth stressing most, as many could have wrote the program much better than I did.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    I worked within best practices for coding across the industry. It is easy to understand what I am doing in the code for those that haven't ever seen it before.
  My professor noted at one point that I was the only student in the course to attempt to solve for the stated requirements in the way that I did, and I think this
  is owed to my attempts to keep the code as digestible as possible for both myself and others that would potentially need to work with it in a real life scenario.
